Visual Analysis of Cohort Study Data  
====================================

####This interface is used for intuitively and effectively filtering a given dataset consisting of about 300 attributes for each participant to create proband subgroups that can then be analyzed using a method of choice.

-----------------

File system
===========

###app  
This folder contains the directives and services that control the data management as well as the individual components.

###data  
This folder contains the data basis for the user interface. This includes the proband data as well as details and structuring of the attributes.  
*attributes.json*:
This file contains all attributes sorted into 12 categories and is used for the visualization as described in 'List of Attributes'.  
*dictionary_new_names.json*:  
This file contains a short description and the type (e.g. nominal, ordinal, ...) for each attribute. These information are needed for displaying the distribution of an attribute according to its type via barchart or graph.  
*breast_fat_labels.csv*:  
This file holds the full dataset of probands consisting of ?.

###bower_components
This folder contains all required files for the used libraries.

###assets
This folder contains additional files such as css files and js files.  
*css*:  
The css files are organized by components. Each folder contains the css file that controls the style of the specific component.  
The main.css is the main stylesheet for the user interface. It holds all the values for the overall layout and arrangement of the components.  
*js*:  
This folder contains the js file for the tooltips used for filter elements. It holds a constructor as well as functions for showing, hiding, removing and manipulating tooltips in terms of attributes, style, direction, offset and content.

###index.html  
This is the default web page that is displayed when entering the URL.  
It is used to structure the interface by arranging the individual components within a grid layout. The components themselves are stored externally in directives (to be found in app/directives) and are just called within the index file.

###app.js  
This file designates the root element of the AngularJS application which is executed once the web page has loaded.  
It is therefore used to load the initial data: *attributes.json*, *dictionary_new_names.json* and *breast_fat_labels.csv* as mentioned above.  
Furthermore, initializing a list to manage the subgroups resulting from filtering takes place here. In the beginning, this list only consists of a subgroup holding the complete dataset. Setting the initially selected subgroup to this subgroup is also done.  
In addition, a list of all attributes containing the distribution and type for each attribute is set up here, whose exact data structure can be checked up in the section "Implementation".  
The app.js file also holds a controller for displaying context information according to the currently selected attribute.

-----------------

Libraries
=========
###AngularJS
This client-side web application framework is used to organize the code according to the model-view-controller architecture and therefore support the development of the user interface.
Among others it consists of directives that are embedded in the HTML document and tell Angular to run some JavaScript code as well as controllers that define the application's behavior by defining functions and values.
###Bootstrap  
This front-end framework supports responsive as well as fast and easy web development and provides various custom HTML and CSS components. It is used for keeping the layout simple and applicable to various devices of different shapes.
###D3  
This JavaScript library helps manipulating documents based on data. It combines powerful visualization components with a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation and therefore is used for simply visualizing the given proband data of the study.

-----------------

Components
==========
###Dataservice (services/data.service.js)  
This class forms the core of data handling.  
It holds all required global variables such as the data basis itself, arising data like created subgroups and metadata about attributes as well as current states e.g. the currently selected attribute or subgroup.  
Furthermore this service provides functions to make use of these data in terms of filtering or exporting created subgroups.

###Barchart (directives/barchart.directive.js)  
This directive creates a barchart visualizing the distribution of a not continuous attribute as soon as such an attribute is selected.  
Filtering can be done by selecting single/multiple bars via mouseclick or selection frame and hitting the button "Apply filter". This creates a new subgroup with probands that fulfill the chosen criteria.
If one or more subgroups have already been created then the bars are subdivided showing the initial distribution (blue) as well as the distribution within the selected subgroup (grey).

###Graph (directives/graph.directive.js)  
This directive creates a line graph visualizing the distribution of a continous attribute as soon as such an attribute is selected.

###Filterbar (directives/filterbar.directive.js)  
This directive shows the history of filter processes.  
For each filtering process a new subgroup is created and visualized in terms of a filter element. Filter processes can be triggered out of every element, resulting in a new subgroup created out of the subgroup represented by the selected element. The arrangement of these elements reflects the course of filtering by means of connecting lines and position.  
A selected subgroup in the filterbar can be saved to the computer by clicking the disk button.

###Progressbar (directives/progressbar.directive.js)  
This directive visualizes how many probands of the initial dataset are left in a subgroup. With each filtering the progressbar is updated showing the percentage of probands in the resulting subgroup compared to the number of probands in the initial dataset.  
Amongst others this prevents the user from creating subgroups with too few probands that are not statistically relevant.

###Searchbar (directives/searchbar.directive.js)  
This searchfield is used to search for a specific attribute whose context information can then be viewed or that can be used for filtering.  
The list of attributes is searched for the searchterm and suggests attributes that match the searchterm or contain it.

###List of Attributes (directives/tree.directive.js)  
Exploring the list of attributes and selecting one of them for further processing is possible using a tree layout.  
A preview of the attributes' distributions can be seen inside the tree layout via small multiples.

Implementation
==============

###services/data.service.js  
#####Variables  
var *dataset*: holds the proband data imported from data/breast_fat_labels.csv.  
type *dataset*: array of objects with every object representing a proband via enumeration of attributes and corresponding values.  
example *dataset*: [{Age: "34", Body_Weight: "68.5", ...}, {...}, ...]  

var *jsondata*: holds a detailed description in english and german as well as the type for each attribute  
type *jsondata*: object with an object for each attribute containing detail, detail_ger and type  
example *jsondata*: {Cohort: {detail: "Cohort affiliation (SHIP-TREND-0 or SHIP-2)", detail_ger: "KohortenzugehÃ¶rigkeit (SHIP-TREND-0 oder SHIP-2)", type: "nominal"}, Examination-Location: {...}, ...}  

var *visdata*: stores the hierarchical structure of attributes organized in categories for the visualization in a tree layout  
type *visdata*: object with root node (name) and array of objects as children which themselves have a name and child nodes  
example *visdata*:  
{name: "root", children: [  
  {name: "Study", \_children: [  
  {name: "Cohort", size: 8883}  
  ]},  
  {name: "Personal", \_children: [  
  {name: "Age", size: 8883},  
  {name: "Marital_Status", size: 8883},  
  {...},  
  {...}  
  ]},  
  {...},  
  ...  
]}  

var *subgroups*: holds the subgroups resulting from filter processes.  
Each time a filter is applied, the resulting subgroup is added to this list. From here they themselves can be filtered to create another subgroup or they can be exported for further analysis.  
Initially this variable consists of a subgroup "all" containing the initial proband dataset before any filtering was done.  
type *subgroups*: array of objects with an object representing a subgroup through row, column, attribute, pred, succ, filtervalues, data and percentage.  
row, column: position for corresponding filterelement inside the imaginary matrix  
attribute: the attribute according to which filtering was done, e.g. Age  
pred: the subgroup from which filtering was done to create this subgroup  
succ: the subgroup that was created by applying a filter on this subgroup  
filtervalues: the values of the given attribute that were used for filtering, e.g. >50  
data: the array of objects representing the resulting probands that fulfill the filtervalues  
percentage: how many probands of the initial number of probands are left?  
Predecessor and successor are stored as the index where the predecessor subgroup or rather the successor subgroup is stored in the list of subgroups. The corresponding subgroup can therefore be accessed through *subgroups*[pred] or *subgroups*[succ].  
example *subgroups*: [{row: 0, column: 0, attribute: "all", pred: -1, succ: 1, filterValues: null, data: *dataset*, percentage: 1}, {row: 0, column: 1, attribute: "Cohort", pred: 0, succ: [], filterValues: "TREND0", data: [...], percentage: 0.62}, {...}, ...]  

var *attributes*: holds the distribution and type for every attribute  
type *attributes*: object with objects containing distribution and type for each attribute  
example *attributes*: {Cohort: {distribution: [{attributeValue: "SHIP2", value: 387}, {attributeValue: "TREND0", value: 631}], type: "nominal"}, Age: {...}, Mobility: {...}, ...}  

var *selectedSub*: holds the subgroup that is currently selected. Used for filtering and export of subgroups. Initialized with the complete proband dataset - the "all" subgroup in *subgroups*.  
type *selectedSub*: object  
example *selectedSub*: {row: 0, column: 1, attribute: "Cohort", pred: 0, succ: [], filterValues: "TREND0", data: [...], percentage: 0.62}

var *currentAttribute*: the attribute that is currently selected, resulting in the corresponding context information (barchart/graph) being displayed. Initially an empty string. Set via click on an attribute in searchbar or tree layout.  
type *currentAttribute*: string  
example *currentAttribute*: "Cohort"

###directives/tree.directive.js  
The tree layout was implemented using the Collapsible Tree of the D3 library (for the example code see http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339083).  
A tree consists of nodes that represent the data and links that represent the hierarchy.  
A node has a *name* e.g. "Study", a *depth* e.g. 1 and an *id* e.g. 10. Its *x and y coordinates* are also stored as well as the *parent* node.
One can also access the children of a given node through *\_children*. This gives not the node itself as a tree node but the name and size as stored in the json file.  
The nodes are labelled as inner nodes and leaf nodes according to their position inside the tree. The inner nodes are the categories and the leaf nodes are the attributes themselves. Each node is represented by a circle and a label and the leaf nodes additionally have a small multiple (example code at http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/1157787) representing the distribution of the bound attribute.  
A link has a *source* and a *target* node and can directly be styled using the css style attribute (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19111581/d3js-force-directed-on-hover-to-node-highlight-colourup-linked-nodes-and-link).  
As the tree layout is used to only represent a list of attributes classified into categories the root node is not needed and therefore hidden by just setting the *hidden* attribute of the root node to true.

###directives/filterbar.directive.js  
Structure:  
Organized in terms of a matrix -> describe more detailed
Labels croppen see http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7555321

-----------------

Future Work
==============

###directives/barchart.directive.js  
The labels of the x axis are way too long and need to be wrapped or cropped. At the moment they are rotated by 45 degrees to prevent overlapping but they still
cannot be seen at their whole length. Either they are wrapped to fit on multiple lines (see http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7555321) or they are cropped at a specific length or one establishes abbreviations for each label.  

###directives/graph.directive.js  
Diskretisierung  

###directives/filterbar.directive.js  
Label fixen: wenn kleines Element geÃ¶ffnet, fehlen Leerzeichen -> Label misses empty spaces when updated (that is the wrap function is called a second time but the words are already split and that crashes)  
Filterungen lÃ¶schen  
Filterung nach mehr als einem Attribut auf einmal -> Zwischen-Subgruppen nicht erzeugen  

###directives/tree.directive.js
At the moment the position and the width and height of the small multiples are fixed. This leads to overlaps when many of the inner nodes of the tree layout are opened because there is not enough vertical space for all of the multiples to fit in without overlapping. Therefore the height and position of the small multiples needs to be dynamically adapted according to the number of leaf nodes that are currently displayed.  
It can also be considered to add the subdivided bars known from the barchart to the small multiples.
